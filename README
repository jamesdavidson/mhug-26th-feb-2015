### Hello world via TCP

How to write simple network servers in Haskell and have fun with GHCâ€™s green threads too.

Three demonstrations:
 * a hello world tcp server (fifteen lines of code)
 * multi threaded hello world tcp server (sixteen lines of code)
 * in-memory key-value buzz-word ultra-low-performance data-store tcp server (fifty lines of code)

Thanks for listening! James

### Excerpt from the Concurrent Haskell paper

Some applications are most easily expressed in a programming language that supports concurrency, notably interactive and distributed systems. We propose extensions to the purely-functional language Haskell that allows it to express explicitly concurrent applications; we call the resulting language Concurrent Haskell.

The resulting system appears to be both expressive and efficient, and we give a number of examples of useful abstractions that can be built from our primitives.

We have developed a freely-available implementation of Concurrent Haskell, and are now using it as a substrate for a graphical user interface toolkit.

### Contributions

Thanks to @koterpillar, @xpika and @andykitchen for changes and additions.

### Running

You can just use the runghc command that comes with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. I doubt you will need to install any packages using cabal but I may be wrong. You can run the tests using nodejs, you'll just need to ```npm install async```.
